# **Working4U**  

## 🧭 Overview  
**Working4U** is a business website built on WordPress and managed under JUCOD. The site belongs to a Canadian-based professional services company and is designed to highlight their workforce support services. The objective was to revamp their existing WordPress site by improving structure, performance, accessibility, and security.

This was a long-term project where I managed everything from technical maintenance to visual redesign and marketing integration.
